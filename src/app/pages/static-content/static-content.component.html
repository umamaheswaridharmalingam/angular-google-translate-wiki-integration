          Wikipedia ( (listen) wik-ih-PEE-dee-ə or (listen) wik-ee-) is a
          multilingual free online encyclopedia written and maintained by a
          community of volunteers through open collaboration and a wiki-based
          editing system. Its editors are known as Wikipedians. Wikipedia is the
          largest and most-read reference work in history. It is consistently
          one of the 10 most popular websites ranked by the Similarweb and
          formerly Alexa; as of 2022, Wikipedia was ranked the 7th most popular
          site. It is hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation, an American non-profit
          organization funded mainly through donations. On January 15, 2001,
          Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger launched Wikipedia. Sanger coined its
          name as a blend of "wiki" and "encyclopedia." Wales was influenced by
          the "spontaneous order" ideas associated with Friedrich Hayek and the
          Austrian School of economics after being exposed to these ideas by
          Austrian economist and Mises Institute Senior Fellow Mark Thornton.
          Initially available only in English, versions in other languages were
          quickly developed. Its combined editions comprise more than 59 million
          articles, attracting around 2 billion unique device visits per month
          and more than 17 million edits per month (1.9 edits per second) as of
          November 2020. In 2006, Time magazine stated that the policy of
          allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the "biggest (and perhaps
          best) encyclopedia in the world." Wikipedia has received praise for
          its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of
          coverage, unique structure, culture, and reduced degree of commercial
          bias; but criticism for exhibiting systemic bias, particularly gender
          bias against women and alleged ideological bias. The reliability of
          Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s but has improved over
          time, as Wikipedia has been generally praised in the late 2010s and
          early 2020s. The website's coverage of controversial topics such as
          American politics and major events like the COVID-19 pandemic has
          received substantial media attention. It has been censored by world
          governments, ranging from specific pages to the entire site. In April
          2018, Facebook and YouTube announced that they would help users detect
          fake news by suggesting fact-checking links to related Wikipedia
          articles. Articles on breaking news are often accessed as a source of
          frequently updated information about those events.

          Corry Tendeloo (3 September 1897 – 18 October 1956) was a Dutch
          lawyer, feminist and politician who sat in the House of
          Representatives for the Free-thinking Democratic League (VDB) from
          1945 until 1946, and then for the Labour Party until her death in
          1956. Born in the Dutch East Indies, Tendeloo studied law at Utrecht
          University, during which time she made contact with people within the
          women's rights movement. In 1945, Tendeloo was appointed a member of
          the House of Representatives for the VDB in the national emergency
          parliament, formed to rebuild the country after World War II and
          organise elections. In 1948, she helped secure universal suffrage for
          the Dutch colonies of Suriname and Curaçao. In 1955, she put forward a
          motion to abolish the ban on state employment for married women. The
          next year she was instrumental in introducing legislation that would
          start to end couverture, a 19th-century law that labelled married
          women as incompetent to act on their own behalf
